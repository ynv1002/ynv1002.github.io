## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between **short-term rentals (STRs) and crime rates in New Orleans**. As STRs have become more popular, concerns about **neighborhood safety and affordability** have grown. This analysis investigates **whether high-density STR areas correlate with increased crime rates** and examines **factors that impact STR permit approvals**.

## Research Questions
1. **Do high-density STR areas experience more crime?**
2. **Are STR applications more likely to be denied in high-crime areas?**
3. **What factors influence STR application approvals?**

## Data Sources
- **[Short-Term Rentals Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/vacation-rentals-hotels-bb-short-term-rentals-etc)** (Location, rental type, bedroom & guest limits)
- **[STR License Applications](https://data.nola.gov/Housing-Land-Use-and-Blight/Map-of-Short-Term-Rental-License-Applications/j5u3-2ueh)** (Approval status, zoning details)
- **[New Orleans Police Incident Reports](https://data.nola.gov/Public-Safety-and-Preparedness/Calls-for-Service-2025/4xwx-sfte/about_data)** (Crime type, location, response times)

## Key Findings
- **23.94% of STR applications were denied** (7,987 out of 33,364), showing that STR regulations are strict.
- **9.57% of STR applications are still pending** (3,194), indicating a large backlog in processing.
- **144 STR permits were revoked**, meaning compliance violations were a factor for some STRs.
- **Average Bedroom & Guest Limits:** The average STR has **X bedrooms** and allows **Y guests** (*pending confirmation*).

## Next Steps
- Merge STR and crime datasets for deeper analysis.
- Explore time-based crime trends before & after **STR policy changes**.
- Create **heatmaps & regression models** to better visualize STR density & crime.
